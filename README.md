## ~ How to play ~

To play this game is very simple. The objective of the game is
to add up the sum that is displayed on the top left corner. If
the colour of the sum is anything but black, then you must choose
the colour coordinated numbers available on the field. Black 
is the wild card colour, you may add up any colour on the board 
you see.

The more numbers you can rally up to reach the sum, the higher 
the bonus multiplier will increase your score.

Start the game, select a game style, time attack or just normal 
play.

### - Time Attack -
Race against time to add up to your sum. Harder diffuculties 
will give more time, but limit the amount of mistakes you are
allowed to make. 

### - Normal Attack -
This practice mode can also be very fun, take as much time as
you want to add up the sums indicated.

More instructions with graphics are available in game.
